# GetInSync NextGen — Session-End Checklist

**Version:** 1.4  
**Date:** February 23, 2026  
**Status:** 🟢 ACTIVE  
**Purpose:** Master checklist Claude executes at session end — dispatches to individual validation skills  
**Trigger:** End of every session with database changes, or on request

---

## How To Use

Claude reads this document at the end of every productive session. Each section determines whether it applies based on what changed during the session, then dispatches to the appropriate skill document for the actual queries and procedures.

**Workflow:**
```
Session ending → Read this checklist → Run applicable sections → Report pass/fail → Produce handover doc
```

---

## Section 1: What Changed This Session?

Before running checks, Claude identifies what was touched. Check all that apply:

| Changed? | Category | Triggers |
|----------|----------|----------|
| ☐ | New tables created | → Run Section 2 (New Table) + Section 3 (Database Validation) |
| ☐ | Existing tables modified (columns, constraints) | → Run Section 3 (Database Validation) |
| ☐ | RLS policies added or changed | → Run Section 3 (Database Validation) |
| ☐ | GRANTs added or changed | → Run Section 3 (Database Validation) |
| ☐ | New views created | → Run Section 4 (Security Validation) |
| ☐ | New functions created | → Run Section 4 (Security Validation) |
| ☐ | Audit triggers added | → Run Section 3 (Database Validation) |
| ☐ | Architecture documents created or updated | → Run Section 5 (Manifest) + Section 6c (Architecture Repo) |
| ☐ | Claude Code changes (UI/frontend) | → Run Section 6 (Deploy Reminder) |
| ☐ | Any database changes at all | → Run Section 6b (Schema Backup) + Section 6c (Architecture Repo) + Section 9 (Stats Alignment) |
| ☐ | Any work done at all | → Run Section 7 (Handover) + Section 10 (Open Items) |
| ☐ | No database changes | → Skip to Section 7 (Handover) + Section 10 (Open Items) |

## Section 2: New Table Validation

**When:** Any new table was created this session.  
**Skill:** `gis-new-table-checklist-v1_0.md` (or `docs-architecture/operations/new-table-checklist.md`)

For each new table, verify:

| # | Check | Query |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Table exists | `SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = '{table}';` |
| 2 | GRANTs exist | `SELECT grantee, privilege_type FROM information_schema.table_privileges WHERE table_name = '{table}' AND grantee IN ('authenticated', 'service_role');` |
| 3 | RLS enabled | `SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = '{table}';` |
| 4 | RLS policies exist | `SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = '{table}';` |
| 5 | Audit trigger (if applicable) | `SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE event_object_table = '{table}' AND trigger_name LIKE '%audit%';` |
| 6 | updated_at trigger (if applicable) | `SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgrelid = 'public.{table}'::regclass AND tgname LIKE 'update_%_updated_at';` |

**Pass criteria:** All applicable checks return expected results.

---

## Section 3: Database Change Validation

**When:** Any table, column, RLS, GRANT, trigger, or constraint changes.  
**Skill:** `gis-database-change-validation-skill-v1_0.md` (or `docs-architecture/operations/database-change-validation.md`)

Run the applicable sections from the validation skill:

| Condition | Validation Skill Section |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| New tables | Section 1: Tables without GRANTs, RLS, policies, triggers |
| Column/constraint changes | Section 2: CHECK constraint alignment |
| RLS policy changes | Section 3: Policy inventory for affected tables |
| Role/enum changes | Section 4: Role alignment with lookup tables |
| FK changes | Section 5: Foreign key ON DELETE review |
| Namespace changes | Section 6: Namespace default workspace check |
| Any DB change | Section 7: Full validation summary |

**Pass criteria:** All validation queries return empty result (no violations).

---

## Section 4: Security Posture Validation

**When:** New views created, new functions created, or Supabase Security Advisor email received.  
**Skill:** `gis-security-validation-runbook-v1_0.md` (or `docs-architecture/identity-security/security-validation-runbook.md`)

| Check | Runbook Section | Quick Query |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Views: security_invoker | Section 1.1 | All views should have `security_invoker=true` |
| Functions: search_path | Section 2.1 | All SECURITY DEFINER functions should have `search_path` set |
| Tables: RLS enabled | Section 3.1 | No public tables with `rowsecurity = false` |
| Tables: RLS has policies | Section 3.2 | No tables with RLS enabled but zero policies |
| Tables: GRANTs exist | Section 3.3 | No tables missing authenticated GRANT |

**One-shot posture query:** Run Section 4 "Full Security Posture Summary" for a single-query dashboard.

**Pass criteria:** All categories show ✅.

---

## Section 5: Architecture Manifest Update

**When:** Any new architecture documents, skills, or runbooks were created or versioned this session.  
**Document:** `gis-architecture-manifest-v1_25.md` (current version)

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| New documents created? | Add to manifest with version, status, description |
| Existing documents versioned? | Update version number in manifest |
| Documents superseded? | Move old version to archive section, update status |
| Manifest version bumped? | Increment version, add changelog entry |

**Pass criteria:** All documents produced this session are cataloged in the manifest.

---

## Section 6: Deploy Reminder

**When:** Claude Code commits were made that modify production-visible features.

Remind Stuart to:
1. **Commit** changes in Claude Code / local repo
2. **Push** to `dev` branch on GitHub
3. **Merge** `dev` → `main` to trigger Netlify production deployment
4. **Verify** the change is live on `nextgen.getinsync.ca`

**Skip if:** Changes were localhost-only testing or database-only (no UI).

---

## Section 6b: Schema Backup

**When:** Any database changes this session (new tables, columns, constraints, triggers, functions, views).

### pg_dump Command

```bash
cd ~/Dev/getinsync-nextgen-ag
pg_dump --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges \
  "postgresql://postgres.zwwuogquncqvwuzbppiq:DB_PASSWORD@aws-1-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres" \
  > getinsync-nextgen-schema-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
```

**Connection details:**
- **User:** `postgres.zwwuogquncqvwuzbppiq`
- **Host:** `aws-1-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com`
- **Port:** `5432`
- **Database:** `postgres`
- **Password:** Stuart provides per session — DO NOT store in docs. Roll after use.

### Verify Dump

```bash
ls -la getinsync-nextgen-schema-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
head -20 getinsync-nextgen-schema-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
```

Expected: ~500-700KB file, starts with `-- PostgreSQL database dump`.

### Commit to Code Repo

```bash
git add getinsync-nextgen-schema-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
git commit -m "Schema backup YYYY-MM-DD: [brief description of changes]"
git push origin dev
```

### Copy to Architecture Repo

```bash
cp getinsync-nextgen-schema-YYYY-MM-DD.sql ~/getinsync-architecture/schema/nextgen-schema-current.sql
```

This ensures the architecture repo always has the latest schema. The dated copy stays in the code repo for history.

### Post-Backup

- **Roll database password** in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
- **Update Claude Code `.env` file** — `~/Dev/getinsync-nextgen-ag/.env` contains the DB password for read-only access. Update it with the new password after rolling.
- Claude Code/Netlify are NOT affected by password changes (use API keys, not DB password)

---

## Section 6c: Architecture Repo Sync

**When:** Architecture documents were created or updated this session (from this chat OR Claude Code), OR schema backup was taken.

### Two Repos, Two Commits

| Repo | Path | Branch | Contains |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Code** | `~/Dev/getinsync-nextgen-ag` | `dev` | Application code, schema backups |
| **Architecture** | `~/getinsync-architecture` | `main` | Architecture docs, current schema, manifest |

Claude Code accesses architecture docs via the symlink `./docs-architecture/` → `~/getinsync-architecture/`.

### Checklist

| # | Check | Action |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | New docs produced in this chat? | Stuart copies to `~/getinsync-architecture/` in correct folder |
| 2 | Claude Code modified `docs-architecture/`? | Verify Claude Code committed and pushed the architecture repo |
| 3 | Schema backup taken (Section 6b)? | Copy dated schema to `~/getinsync-architecture/schema/nextgen-schema-current.sql` |
| 4 | Manifest updated (Section 5)? | Ensure `MANIFEST.md` in architecture repo reflects changes |
| 5 | Architecture repo clean? | Run verification below |

### Verification

```bash
cd ~/getinsync-architecture && git status && git log --oneline -3 && cd ~/Dev/getinsync-nextgen-ag
```

**Expected:** Clean working tree, latest commit matches this session's work.

### When This Chat Produces Documents

This Claude Project chat cannot push to git. When architecture docs are created here:

1. Stuart downloads the file from this chat
2. Stuart copies it to the correct folder in `~/getinsync-architecture/`
3. Stuart commits and pushes:
   ```bash
   cd ~/getinsync-architecture
   git add -A
   git commit -m "docs: [description of new/updated doc]"
   git push
   cd ~/Dev/getinsync-nextgen-ag
   ```

**Pass criteria:** `git status` in `~/getinsync-architecture` shows clean working tree, latest commit matches this session's work.

---

## Section 7: Session Handover Document

**When:** Always — every session that did meaningful work.

Produce a `session-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md` covering:

| Section | What to include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Completed** | SQL applied, Claude Code changes, architecture decisions made |
| **Database changes** | Tables created/modified, RLS policies, triggers, functions, views |
| **Frontend changes** | Claude Code commits, components modified |
| **Files created** | Architecture docs, skills, runbooks |
| **Validation results** | Pass/fail for each check run from Sections 2–5 |
| **Repo status** | Both repos committed and pushed? |
| **Still open** | Bugs, next steps, pending work |
| **Context for next session** | What the next Claude instance needs to know |

---

## Section 8: Monthly SOC2 Evidence (If Applicable)

**When:** First session of each month, or when explicitly requested.  
**Skill:** `gis-soc2-evidence-collection-skill.md`

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Run `generate_soc2_evidence()` RPC | Produces monthly snapshot JSON |
| Name file per convention | `GIS-SOC2-EV-{seq}-{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}.json` |
| Compare to previous month | Note any variance in table/policy/trigger counts |
| Log in evidence index | Update `gis-soc2-evidence-index` if it exists |

**Pass criteria:** Snapshot collected, named correctly, variance explained.

---

## Section 9: Cross-Document Stats Alignment

**When:** Any database changes this session (tables, triggers, views, policies, functions).  
**Purpose:** Prevent stat drift across documents that reference database counts.

### 9.1 — Collect Current Stats

Run this single query to get the source of truth:

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public') as tables,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public') as rls_policies,
  (SELECT count(DISTINCT trigger_name) FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_schema = 'public' AND trigger_name LIKE 'audit_%') as audit_triggers,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class c JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace 
   WHERE n.nspname = 'public' AND c.relkind = 'v') as views,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_proc p JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = p.pronamespace 
   WHERE n.nspname = 'public') as functions;
```

### 9.2 — Check for Drift

Compare the query results against these documents. If any are stale, flag for update:

| Document | Section | What to Check |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `gis-architecture-manifest-v1_XX.md` | Schema Statistics | tables, views, functions, RLS policies, audit triggers, schema backup date |
| `gis-soc2-evidence-index-v1_0.md` | Current Readiness Score + CC6.6 rows | table count, trigger count, policy count |
| `gis-security-posture-automated-overview-v1_1.md` | Timeline section + body stats | table count, trigger count, policy count, view count |
| Claude memory | SOC2 + RLS memory entries | table count, trigger count |

### 9.3 — Update or Flag

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Stats match everywhere | ✅ PASS — no action |
| Stats drifted in 1-2 docs | Update the docs in this session if time permits, otherwise flag in open items |
| Stats drifted in 3+ docs | **Update all docs now** — drift compounds across sessions |
| Schema backup date is stale | Flag in Section 6b |

**Pass criteria:** All documents reference the same table/trigger/policy counts, or drift is flagged in open items.

---

## Section 10: Open Items Maintenance

**When:** Every session — this is how the backlog stays alive.  
**Document:** `gis-open-items-priority-matrix.md`

### 10.1 — Harvest New Items

Review the session for anything that was:
- Discovered but not fixed (bugs, design debt, data quality issues)
- Deferred deliberately ("parked", "future", "not today")
- Promised but not delivered (Claude Code changes sent but unconfirmed)
- Dependencies identified (X blocks Y)

### 10.2 — Classify New Items

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **HIGH** | Blockers, schema issues, critical path items |
| **MED** | Security/compliance gaps, SOC2 policy gaps, enablement blockers |
| **LOW** | UI polish, cosmetic bugs, future features |

### 10.3 — Close Completed Items

Move items to the "Completed This Session" section with resolution notes. Don't just delete them — the audit trail matters.

### 10.4 — SOC2 Policy Gap Check

Reference `gis-soc2-evidence-index-v1_0.md` § "Policy Documents Needed":

| Policy | Status | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Information Security Policy | ⬜ Not started | HIGH — before Knowledge |
| Change Management Policy | ⬜ Not started | HIGH — before Knowledge |
| Incident Response Plan | ⬜ Not started | HIGH — before Knowledge |
| Acceptable Use Policy | ⬜ Not started | MED — before first enterprise deal |
| Data Classification Policy | ⬜ Not started | MED — before first enterprise deal |
| Business Continuity Plan | ⬜ Not started | MED — before first enterprise deal |
| Vendor Management Policy | ⬜ Not started | LOW — before SOC2 audit |
| Data Retention Policy | ⬜ Not started | LOW — already enforced in code |

When any policy is drafted, update both this table AND the evidence index.

### 10.5 — Reproduce Updated List

If items were added or completed, produce an updated `gis-open-items-priority-matrix.md` (no date suffix — one file, always current) and present it to Stuart for upload to the project.

**Pass criteria:** All new items captured, completed items closed, SOC2 policy gap status current.
