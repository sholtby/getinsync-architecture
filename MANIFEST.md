# MANIFEST.md
GetInSync NextGen Architecture Manifest
Last updated: 2026-03-04

---

## Purpose

This manifest serves as the master index of all architecture documents for GetInSync NextGen. Use this to navigate the architecture documentation and understand the current state of the system.

### Document Status Convention

Every document is tagged with its relationship to the production system:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 🟢 AS-BUILT | Accurately describes production |
| 🟡 AS-DESIGNED | Architecture approved, not yet implemented |
| 🟠 NEEDS UPDATE | Concept valid, contains stale stack references |
| ☪ REFERENCE | Stack-agnostic methodology or reference material |

---

## Document Sources — Two Environments

Architecture docs are maintained in a **git repo** (`~/getinsync-architecture`). This is the single source of truth — version history is tracked by git, not by filename suffixes.

Stuart keeps a subset of key files synced to the **Claude Opus project** for context. These are the 9 project files Opus can read:

| Opus Project Filename | Grab From (~/getinsync-architecture/) | Purpose |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| `MANIFEST.md` | `MANIFEST.md` | This file — document index |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code rules (auto-read) |
| `development-rules.md` | `operations/development-rules.md` | Dev workflow rules |
| `session-end-checklist.md` | `operations/session-end-checklist.md` | Session-end validation |
| `open-items-priority-matrix.md` | `planning/open-items-priority-matrix.md` | Living backlog |
| `nextgen-schema-current.sql` | `schema/nextgen-schema-current.sql` | Latest schema reference |
| `session-summary-current.md` | `sessions/2026-02-23-complete.md` | Latest session context |
| `it-value-creation-v2.jsx` | `features/it-value-creation/mockup-v2.jsx` | Active UI mockup |
| `Q1-2026-Gantt-v2.xlsx` | `planning/q1-2026-gantt-v2.xlsx` | Project timeline |

**Retired filenames** (do not reference these):
- `gis-architecture-manifest-v1_25.md` → now `MANIFEST.md`
- `getinsync-development-rules-v1_4.md` → now `development-rules.md`
- `gis-session-end-checklist-v1_3.md` / `v1_4` → now `session-end-checklist.md`
- `gis-open-items-priority-matrix.md` → now `open-items-priority-matrix.md`
- `getinsync-nextgen-schema-2026-02-22.sql` → now `nextgen-schema-current.sql`
- `session-summary-2026-02-22-complete.md` → now `session-summary-current.md`

**Rules:**
- The **repo** is always authoritative. If a project file conflicts with the repo, the repo wins.
- Stuart syncs project files manually after Claude Code sessions.
- Version history is tracked by git. Project filenames do not carry version numbers or dates.
- The full document library (86 docs) lives in the repo. Opus sees only the 9 files above.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Namespace = Hard Boundary
- Nothing crosses namespace boundaries except platform admin operations
- RLS enforces isolation at database level
- Each namespace is a separate legal entity
- Multi-namespace access via `namespace_users` table

### 2. CSDM-Aligned from Day One
- Map directly to ServiceNow tables
- No migration needed when syncing
- Business Application vs Application Service pattern

### 3. DP-Centric Assessment
- Deployment Profile is the assessment anchor, not Application
- Same app can have different technical scores in different deployments

### 4. Cost Attribution
- Every dollar needs a home and an owner
- Three cost channels: Software Products, IT Services, Cost Bundles
- No cost fields on Application or Deployment Profile directly

### 5. Progressive Disclosure
- Tier-based feature gating (trial/essentials/plus/enterprise)
- Features unlock at higher tiers
- Upgrade teasers show value

### 6. Data Residency
- Region column on namespaces (ca/us/eu)
- Canada live, US/EU on-demand when first customer requires
- Multi-region = separate Supabase projects per region

### 7. Granular Security
- 4-policy pattern: Separate SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies
- Platform admin override across all namespaces
- Namespace admin multi-tenant support
- Workspace-level roles: admin/editor/steward/viewer/restricted

### 8. As-Designed ≠ As-Built
- Every document must declare its status (🟢/🟡/🟠/☪)
- "Last validated against production" date required
- Architecture docs that reference deprecated tech are a liability, not documentation

### 9. Two-Path Technology Model (Feb 13, 2026)
- **Path 1:** Direct inventory tags on deployment profiles (NO cost columns) — simple, all tiers
- **Path 2:** IT Service cost/blast radius as maturity layer — structured, Enterprise tier
- Technology tagging is inventory; cost flows through established channels only
- Reconciliation view bridges the gap between paths

### 10. Risk Boundary — APM vs GRC (Feb 13, 2026)
- GetInSync surfaces **computed risk indicators** from technology lifecycle data
- Risk registers, TRA tracking, and risk acceptance workflows are **GRC territory**
- "We detect the risks. GRC tools manage the response."
- Server hostnames, IPs, vulnerability counts are **CMDB/Discovery territory**

### 11. Audit-Log-Driven Event Sourcing (Feb 14, 2026)
- Single `audit_logs` table serves three purposes: SOC2 compliance, gamification achievements, activity feed
- No new instrumentation on business tables — achievements computed from existing audit data
- Silent computation: engine runs regardless of user opt-out, enabling instant opt-back-in
- Same pattern extensible to future features (anomaly detection, usage analytics)

### 12. View-to-TypeScript Contract Enforcement (Feb 17, 2026)
- `src/types/view-contracts.ts` is single source of truth for view-to-TypeScript mappings
- When a database view changes, update the contract file; TypeScript catches all consumers
- Prevents silent mismatches where UI reads undefined columns (budget view class of bug)

### 13. Self-Organizing Dashboard Scoping (Feb 22, 2026)
- Programs visible to workspace users via initiative membership — no manual WorkspaceGroup tagging required
- Full program context always shown (total budget, all initiatives) — never sliced by workspace filter
- NULL workspace_id = namespace-wide scope for findings and programs
- WorkspaceGroups remain for catalog sharing (publisher/consumer) only — not overloaded for entity visibility

## Recent Changes (v1.25 → v1.26)

### Automated Testing & Explicit GRANTs (Feb 23, 2026)

**Database changes (no schema, GRANTs only):**
- Explicit `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` applied to all 90 tables for both `authenticated` and `service_role` roles
- Previously relied on implicit schema-level default privileges — now explicit and auditable per SOC2 requirements
- Baseline validated: 297/297 checks PASS (90 RLS + 90 auth GRANTs + 90 service_role GRANTs + 37 audit triggers + 27 security_invoker views)

**New documents (2):**
- `testing/pgtap-rls-coverage.sql` — **NEW (🟢).** Full pgTAP regression suite: 391 assertions covering RLS, GRANTs, audit triggers, view security, sentinel checks for drift detection.
- `testing/security-posture-validation.sql` — **NEW (🟢).** Standalone validator requiring no extensions. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor, produces PASS/FAIL table with failures sorted to top.

**Document updates (3):**
- `operations/development-rules.md` — **v1.4 → v1.5.** Added §2.3 (pgTAP security regression suite). Updated §3.1 schema filename to stable name. Updated §4.3 to include pgTAP in session-end compliance pass. Added pgTAP row to Quick Reference table.
- `operations/session-end-checklist.md` — **v1.4 → v1.5.** Added §6d automated security regression step (pgTAP or standalone).
- `MANIFEST.md` — **v1.25 → v1.26.** New "Testing" section. Updated dev-rules + checklist entries. Updated document count.

**New manifest section:** "Testing" added between "Security & Operations" and "Integration & Alignment".

**Schema statistics:** No table/view/function changes. Explicit GRANTs row added to stats table.

**Document count:** 84 → 86 (+2 test files).

## Previous Changes (v1.23 → v1.24)

### Claude Code Cutover & Phase 28 Completion (Feb 17, 2026)

**Tooling change:**
- **Claude Code (v2.1.44) replaces AG (Antigravity/bolt.new) as primary frontend development tool.** AG remains as fallback.
- `CLAUDE.md` created in repo root — auto-read by Claude Code at session start. Contains architecture rules, impact analysis requirements, database access policy, and do-not list.
- `src/types/view-contracts.ts` created — 10 TypeScript interfaces matching every Supabase view the app queries. Single source of truth for view-to-TypeScript mappings.
- `operations/development-rules.md` — rewritten for Claude Code workflow. AG rules moved to fallback section.
- Read-only database access configured for Claude Code (SELECT-only via policy).

**Phase 28 Integration Bugs — ALL 13 CLOSED:**
- 8 reference tables created (criticality_types, integration_direction_types, integration_method_types, integration_frequency_types, integration_status_types, data_format_types, sensitivity_types, data_classification_types)
- All integration dropdowns now DB-driven (dev rule 1.4 compliance)
- Data tags multi-select added to integration modal
- Integration count badges on app list rows
- 9 inline TypeScript types migrated to view-contracts.ts
- Stale NamespaceUser role type fixed (admin|member|viewer → admin|editor|steward|viewer|restricted)

**View fix:**
- `vw_workspace_budget_summary` rewritten to read from `workspace_budgets` table instead of legacy `workspaces.budget_amount` column.

**Schema statistics:**
- Tables: 72 → 80 (+8 integration reference tables)
- Audit triggers: 17 → 25 (+8 on new reference tables)
- RLS policies: 279+ → 307 (+16 on new tables, +12 from prior sessions)
- Schema backup: 2026-02-13 → 2026-02-17

**New architecture principle:**
- Principle 12: View-to-TypeScript Contract Enforcement

**New manifest sections:**
- "Development Workflow" — tracks development rules, team workflow, CLAUDE.md

**Documents marked stale:**
- security-posture-overview v1.1 → 🟠 (stats reference 72 tables/17 triggers, now 80/25)
- soc2-evidence-collection-skill v1.0 → 🟠 (trigger list says 11 tables, now 25)
- team-workflow-skill v1.0 → 🟠 (references AG as primary)

**Document count:** 80 → 83 (+3: development-rules-v1_4, CLAUDE.md, view-contracts.ts as tracked code artifact).

## Previous Changes (v1.22 → v1.23)

### Infrastructure Boundary & Lifecycle Intelligence Update (Feb 14, 2026)

**2 document changes:**
- `features/technology-health/infrastructure-boundary-rubric.md` — **NEW.** What infrastructure data belongs in APM vs CMDB. Decision tree, staleness principle, worked examples, server_name governance. Added to "Technology Health & Risk" section.
- `features/technology-health/lifecycle-intelligence.md` — **v1.0 → v1.1.** Two-path model integration: Path 1 technology product entry point, technology tagging flow, 2 new risk views (vw_technology_tag_lifecycle_risk, vw_dp_lifecycle_risk_combined), T02 score suggestion table.

**Pending schema corrections:**
- `deployment_profiles.server_name`: Changed from DROP to ADD (text, optional). Infrastructure Boundary Rubric establishes server_name is retained as conditional reference label for on-prem servers, not dropped.
- `technology_products.lifecycle_reference_id`: Added (UUID FK to technology_lifecycle_reference). Path 1 entry point for lifecycle intelligence.
- 2 new views added to pending: vw_technology_tag_lifecycle_risk, vw_dp_lifecycle_risk_combined.

**Architecture changelog** updated v1.9 to include both parallel sessions' work.

**Document count:** 79 → 80.

## Previous Changes (v1.21 → v1.22)

### Gamification & Data Governance Architecture (Feb 14, 2026)

**1 new document created:**
- `features/gamification/architecture.md` — Achievements, data quality flags, activity feed, email digest, re-engagement. Audit-log-driven event sourcing from existing audit_logs infrastructure.

**New manifest section:** "Gamification & Data Governance" added to track gamification architecture.

**Pending schema changes added:** 4 new tables (gamification_achievements, gamification_user_progress, gamification_user_stats, flags), 1 table modification (namespaces +enable_achievement_digests), 1 new view (flag_summary_by_workspace), 9 new functions.

**1 new architecture principle:**
- Principle 11: Audit-Log-Driven Event Sourcing — single audit_logs table serves SOC2, gamification, and activity feed

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Achievement engine reads existing audit_logs — no new instrumentation, zero write overhead
- Silent computation: runs regardless of opt-out for instant re-activation
- Three-level opt-out: namespace master → user gamification UI → user email digest
- Data quality flags use polymorphic entity reference (same pattern as audit_logs)
- Flags separate from risk management per existing ADR — governance, not GRC
- Activity feed generated on-demand with adaptive time bucketing (not materialized)
- Resend email integration: weekly digest + 14-day dormancy re-engagement with 30-day cooldown

**Marketing explainer** updated v1.6 → v1.7: Data Governance & User Engagement value proposition.

**Architecture changelog** updated v1.8 → v1.9.

## Previous Changes (v1.20 → v1.21)

### Technology Health Architecture (Feb 13, 2026)

**5 new documents created:**
- `features/technology-health/dashboard.md` — Dashboard spec: field mapping, schema changes, database views, UI wireframes
- `features/technology-health/technology-stack-erd-addendum.md` — Two-path model: Path 1 (inventory tags, no cost) + Path 2 (IT Service cost/blast radius)
- `features/cost-budget/cost-model-addendum.md` — Confirms zero cost model impact from technology tagging
- `features/technology-health/risk-boundary.md` — ADR: Risk registers = GRC territory; GetInSync = computed risk indicators
- `gis-marketing-explainer-v1_6-additions.md` — New sections 9 (Technology Health), 10 (Risk Boundary), updated buyer personas

**New manifest section:** "Technology Health & Risk" added to track dashboard architecture and risk boundary ADR.

**Pending schema changes section added** — 8 table modifications and 3 new views designed but not deployed.

**2 new architecture principles:**
- Principle 9: Two-Path Technology Model (inventory vs cost/blast radius)
- Principle 10: Risk Boundary — APM vs GRC

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Two-path technology model: simple inventory tags (Path 1) + IT Service maturity layer (Path 2)
- Risk registers are GRC territory; GetInSync provides computed risk indicators only
- Server names/IPs are CMDB/Discovery territory; excluded from deployment profiles
- Crown Jewel flag lives on applications (not deployment profiles)

**Marketing explainer** updated v1.5 → v1.6: Technology Health, Risk Boundary, crawl-to-walk positioning, economic buyer personas (ServiceNow Platform Owner, CIO, CISO).

**Architecture changelog** updated v1.7 → v1.8.
