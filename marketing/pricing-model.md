# GetInSync NextGen Pricing Model
## Version 1.0 - December 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the commercial pricing model for GetInSync NextGen, aligned with the strategic pivot from SME to enterprise customers. The model is designed to:

- Target organizations that can afford ServiceNow but want a simpler, faster alternative
- Provide clear tier differentiation with logical upgrade paths
- Leverage the Steward role as an Enterprise differentiator
- Support the MSP/Partner channel at entry level
- Validate against the City of Garland baseline ($50K/year)

---

## 2. Strategic Positioning

### Target Market Shift

| Segment | Previous Focus | NextGen Focus |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| SME (<200 employees) | Primary | Exit |
| Mid-market (200-1000 emp) | Secondary | Entry (Essentials) |
| Mid-Enterprise (1000-5000 emp) | Limited | Primary (Plus) |
| Large Enterprise / Government | Limited | Primary (Enterprise) |

### Competitive Positioning

| Factor | ServiceNow APM | GetInSync |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Annual cost | $150K - $500K+ | $15K - $150K |
| Implementation | 6-12 months, $200K+ | 2-4 weeks, included |
| Complexity | High (dedicated admin) | Low (self-service) |
| Time to value | 12-18 months | 30-60 days |
| Target buyer | CIO with $1M+ budget | IT Director with $50-150K budget |

**Value Proposition:** Enterprise-grade application portfolio management at a fraction of ServiceNow's cost and complexity.

---

## 3. Tier Structure

### Overview

| Tier | Annual Price | Workspaces | Editors | Target Customer |
|------|--------------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Essentials** | $15,000 | 5 | 5 | Entry enterprise, MSP channel |
| **Plus** | $30,000 | 10 | 10 | Mid-enterprise |
| **Enterprise** | $62,500 | 25 | 25 | Large enterprise, Government |

### Core Principle: 1:1 Editor-to-Workspace Ratio

Each tier includes 1 Editor per Workspace as the baseline. This is intentionally lean because:

1. **Steward Role (Enterprise):** Application Owners update their own data without Editor licenses
2. **Add-on Flexibility:** Customers purchase additional Editors as needed
3. **Simple Pricing:** Easy to understand and quote

### Unlimited Inclusions (All Tiers)

| Feature | Included |
|---------|----------|
| Read-Only Users | Unlimited |
| Dashboard Access | Unlimited |
| Applications | Unlimited |
| IT Services | Unlimited |
| Portfolios | Unlimited |

## 5. Add-on Pricing

### Additional Capacity

| Add-on | Essentials | Plus | Enterprise |
|--------|------------|------|------------|
| Additional Workspace (+1 Editor) | N/A (upgrade to Plus) | $3,500/yr | $3,000/yr |
| Additional Editor | $2,000/yr | $2,500/yr | $2,000/yr |

### Pricing Logic

- **Enterprise has lower per-unit add-on costs** (volume discount)
- **Plus has higher per-Editor cost** to encourage Enterprise upgrade at scale
- **Essentials cannot add Workspaces** (forces upgrade to Plus for growth)

### Editor Pool Model

Editors are pooled at the Namespace level:

- Editors can be assigned to any Workspace within the Namespace
- One user can be Editor in multiple Workspaces (counts as 1 license)
- Namespace Admin controls Editor allocation across Workspaces

---

## 6. Discounts

### Standard Discounts

| Discount Type | Amount | Requirement |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Public Sector | 20% | Federal, State/Provincial, Local Government |
| Nonprofit | 25% | Registered 501(c)(3) or equivalent |
| Education | 25% | K-12, Higher Education |
| 3-Year Prepay | 15% | **Full 3 years paid upfront at signing** |

### Partner Discounts

| Partner Type | Model | Margin |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Reseller (e.g., Kip Fanta Group) | Partner invoices customer | 20% of customer price |
| Referral | GetInSync invoices customer | 10% of Year 1 ACV |

### Discount Stacking

Discounts are applied sequentially:

1. Tier list price
2. Public Sector / Nonprofit / Education discount
3. 3-Year prepay discount (if applicable)
4. Partner margin (if applicable)

**Example: Government customer, 3-year prepay, through partner**

| Step | Calculation |
|------|-------------|
| List | $62,500/year |
| Public Sector (20%) | -$12,500 = $50,000/year |
| 3-Year Prepay (15%) | -$7,500 = $42,500/year |
| **3-Year Total Due at Signing** | $42,500 × 3 = **$127,500** |
| Partner Margin (20% of total) | -$25,500 |
| **GetInSync Receives** | **$102,000** |

---

## 7. Contract Terms

### Commitment Periods

| Term | Discount | Payment | Due at Signing |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1-Year | None | Annual upfront | Year 1 amount |
| 3-Year | 15% | **All 3 years upfront** | 3 × discounted annual |

### Why 3-Year Prepay?

The 15% discount requires full prepayment because:

| Benefit to Customer | Benefit to GetInSync |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Real NPV savings (~$15K on Enterprise) | Cash upfront |
| Price locked for 3 years | Churn risk eliminated |
| Simplified budgeting (one PO) | No renewal sales cost |
| | Predictable revenue |

**NPV Analysis (at 5% discount rate):**
- Paying annually: NPV = $142,970
- Paying 3-year upfront with 15% off: NPV = $127,500
- **Customer saves ~$15,470 in real terms**

### No Monthly Option

Monthly billing is not available. This:
- Aligns with enterprise buyer expectations
- Reduces churn risk
- Simplifies billing operations
- Encourages customer investment in success

### Price Protection

| Term | Price Changes |
|------|---------------|
| 1-Year | Up to 5% increase at renewal |
| 3-Year | Price locked for term |

### Auto-Renewal

| Term | Renewal Behavior |
|------|------------------|
| 1-Year | Auto-renews annually; 60-day notice to cancel |
| 3-Year | Converts to 1-year at then-current pricing; 60-day notice to cancel |

**Calculation:**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|

| Additional Editors | $0 (24 < 25) |
| **List Total** | **$62,500** |

| **List Total** | **$118,500** |
| Public Sector Discount (20%) | -$23,700 |
| **Customer Pays** | **$94,800** |

| Per-Client Cost | $3,000 |
| MSP Charges Client | $5,000 - $8,000 |
| **MSP Margin** | $2,000 - $5,000 per client |

---

## 9. Upgrade Paths

### Essentials → Plus Triggers

| Trigger | Why Plus |
|---------|----------|
| Need SSO / Entra ID | Security requirement |
| More than 5 Workspaces | Capacity limit |
| Need Restricted Role | External contractor access |
| Editor count > 8 | Plus becomes more economical |

### Plus → Enterprise Triggers

| Trigger | Why Enterprise |
|---------|----------------|
| Need Steward Role | Application Owners self-serve |
| Need API Access | Integration requirements |
| Need Custom Analytics | Advanced reporting |
| More than 10 Workspaces | Capacity limit |
| Editor count > 20 | Enterprise becomes more economical |

### Crossover Analysis

| Profile | Plus Cost | Enterprise Cost | Better Value |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 10 WS, 10 Editors | $30,000 | $62,500 | Plus |
| 10 WS, 15 Editors | $42,500 | $62,500 | Plus |
| 10 WS, 20 Editors | $55,000 | $62,500 | Plus (barely) |
| 10 WS, 24 Editors | $65,000 | $62,500 | **Enterprise** |
| 15 WS, 15 Editors | $47,500 | $62,500 | Plus |
| 15 WS, 25 Editors | $72,500 | $62,500 | **Enterprise** |

**Rule of Thumb:** Enterprise becomes better value at ~24+ Editors or when Steward/API is needed.

## 10. The Steward Value Proposition

### The Problem Steward Solves

Without Steward:
- Application Owners need Editor licenses to update their app data
- 100 Application Owners = 100 Editor licenses = $200,000+ in add-ons
- OR: Shadow spreadsheets, stale data, defeated purpose

With Steward (Enterprise):
- Application Owners get Steward rights automatically (as Owner contact)
- Unlimited Stewards included in Enterprise
- Only power users (IT Analysts, Portfolio Managers) need Editor licenses

### Steward Capabilities

| Can Do | Cannot Do |
|--------|-----------|
| Edit Business Fit (TIME) | Edit Technology Fit |
| Edit basic metadata | Edit Deployment Profiles |
| Add Delegates (max 2) | Edit Contracts |
| View all Workspace data | Create/Delete Applications |
| Access dashboards | Manage Portfolios |

### Sales Messaging

> "Enterprise includes unlimited Stewards. Your Application Owners can update their own Business Fit data—no Editor license required. 
>
> If you have 50 Application Owners on Plus, you'd need 50 Editor licenses at $2,500 each = $125,000 in add-ons.
>
> On Enterprise at $62,500, those 50 owners are Stewards—included. That's $62,500 in savings on Day 1, and it scales with you."
