GetInSync NextGen — Positioning & Messaging
Last updated: 2026-01-22

## 1. Purpose

This document captures the core positioning statements, value propositions, and competitive differentiators for GetInSync NextGen. Use these in sales conversations, presentations, proposals, and marketing materials.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### The Money Principle

> **"Every dollar needs a home and an owner."**

This is the foundational design principle of GetInSync's cost model. No mystery costs. No orphaned spend. Every dollar flows through a defined channel (Software Product, IT Service, or Cost Bundle), is attributed to a vendor, and rolls up to a business application with an accountable owner.

### The Reality Principle

> **"Same app, different deployments = different assessments. Because reality."**

The same software deployed in different environments has different technical fitness. Production on legacy infrastructure ≠ DR in the cloud. GetInSync's Deployment Profile-centric model captures this reality. You assess deployments, not abstract software.

### The Freshness Principle

> **"Criticality that stays current — derived from active assessment, not a stale checkbox."**

Static "crown jewel" flags become stale theater. GetInSync derives criticality from active B-score assessment, ensuring portfolio priorities reflect current business reality, not a checkbox someone set three years ago.

## 3. Competitive Positioning

### vs. EA Tools (Orbus, LeanIX, Ardoq)

> **"GetInSync tackles the money beast. Most APM/EA tools avoid money altogether — making it EA theater, not business application management."**

Enterprise Architecture tools focus on modeling relationships and capabilities. They treat cost as an afterthought — an optional field, not a first-class citizen. GetInSync puts cost at the center because that's what business decisions actually require.

> **"You've had Orbus for 28 months with zero apps loaded. That's a tool problem, not a team problem."**

Complex metamodel configuration, custom object creation, and consultant-dependent implementations mean EA tools often sit shelfware. GetInSync delivers value in weeks, not years.

> **"Orbus is an EA modeling platform. You need APM. Different tools for different jobs."**

Don't bring an architecture modeling tool to a portfolio management fight.

### vs. ServiceNow APM

> **"We're CSDM-aligned out of the box. No metamodel configuration. No custom objects to build."**

GetInSync aligns with ServiceNow's Common Service Data Model, enabling clean data migration when organizations are ready for ServiceNow — without requiring ServiceNow's complexity or cost to get started.

### vs. Spreadsheets

> **"Who's ripping me off?"**

This is the question IT finance actually asks. Spreadsheets can't answer it because they lack vendor attribution, contract tracking, and cost channel traceability. GetInSync can.

> **"Which spreadsheet is current?"**

The ninja spreadsheet nightmare: multiple versions, no audit trail, manual updates, broken formulas. GetInSync provides a single source of truth with full traceability.

## 4. Product Positioning

### The Elevator Pitch

> **"GetInSync is the QuickBooks for CSDM — hiding complex data modeling behind simple user interfaces so average users can manage enterprise architecture without understanding underlying CSDM complexity."**

### The Value Stack

| Layer | Statement |
|-------|-----------|
| **Strategic** | Know what you have, what it costs, and what to do about it |
| **Operational** | Every dollar has a home and an owner |
| **Technical** | CSDM-aligned, ServiceNow-ready, no consultant required |

---

## 5. Feature-Specific Messaging

### TIME/PAID Assessment

> **"TIME answers 'what should we do with this application?' PAID answers 'how urgently do we need to fix technical debt?'"**

Two complementary frameworks:
- **TIME** (Tolerate/Invest/Modernize/Eliminate) — Strategic direction
- **PAID** (Plan/Address/Improve/Divest) — Technical debt priority

### Deployment Profiles

> **"You don't assess software. You assess deployments."**

Abstract software has no technical fitness. A specific deployment — in a specific environment, on specific infrastructure, with specific DR posture — does.

### Steward Role

> **"200 App Owners as Editors: $400,000/year. 200 App Owners as Stewards: $0."**

The Steward role lets application owners update business fit assessments without requiring Editor licenses. Data stays fresh without breaking the budget.

### Cost Model

> **"Three clean channels. No mystery costs."**

Every cost flows through one of three channels:
1. **Software Products** — Licensing and subscriptions
2. **IT Services** — Shared infrastructure allocations
3. **Cost Bundles** — Everything else (MSP, consulting, support)

### Vendor Attribution

> **"Microsoft makes it. CDW sells it. Those are different questions with different answers."**

Manufacturer ≠ Vendor. GetInSync tracks both:
- **Manufacturer** — Who makes the software (on the catalog)
- **Vendor** — Who you pay (on the deployment relationship)

### Run Rate vs. Projects

> **"Run rate is operational. Projects are temporary. Mixing them is lying to your CFO."**

GetInSync separates:
- **Recurring costs** → Run rate (what it costs to keep the lights on)
- **One-time costs** → Projects (implementations, migrations, upgrades)

### Budget Management

> **"How much do I have left? Can I borrow from that pot?"**

GetInSync replaces the ninja spreadsheet with:
- Workspace-level budget pools
- Application-level allocations
- Transfer tracking with full audit trail
- Real-time run rate vs. budget comparison

## 6. Proof Points

### Time to Value

| Tool | Time to Value |
|------|---------------|
| Orbus iServer | 6-12+ months |
| ServiceNow APM | 3-6 months |
| **GetInSync** | **30-60 days** |

### The Orbus Story

> "28 months. Zero applications loaded. $XXX,XXX spent. That's not a team failure — that's a tool failure."

### The Steward Math

> "At $2,000/Editor, 200 application owners would cost $400,000/year just to update their own data. Steward eliminates that cost entirely at the Enterprise tier."

## 7. Objection Handlers

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have ServiceNow" | "Great — we're CSDM-aligned. Use us to get your data clean, then migrate when ready. Or keep using both — we complement, not compete." |
| "We use spreadsheets and they work fine" | "Which version is current? Who changed that number? Can you tell me total spend by vendor in under 5 minutes?" |
| "Orbus/LeanIX does this" | "Have you loaded your applications yet? How long did configuration take? Can your app owners update their own data?" |
| "We don't track costs in our APM tool" | "Then how do you answer 'should we keep this application?' without knowing what it costs?" |
| "This seems expensive" | "What's the cost of NOT knowing? One missed contract renewal. One compliance gap. One redundant application running for years." |

---

## 8. Tagline Options

| Tagline | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **"Every dollar. Every app. Every answer."** | General positioning |
| **"APM that speaks money."** | CFO/finance audience |
| **"The QuickBooks for CSDM."** | Technical audience |
| **"Portfolio clarity in weeks, not years."** | Competitive positioning |
| **"Know what you have. Know what it costs. Know what to do."** | Executive summary |
