# April 2026 Level Set — Feature Sequencing & ADR Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** April 3, 2026
**Author:** Stuart Holtby + Claude

---

## 1. Purpose

This document sequences all outstanding ADRs, major features, and architectural work into a phased delivery plan. It establishes dependencies, groups work that shares schema or UI surface area, and identifies independent work that can fill gaps or run in parallel.

**Scope:** Everything in the ADR backlog, open items priority matrix, and feature roadmap as of April 2026.

## 4. Staged Delivery Plan

### Stage A: DP Enhancement — Contract Awareness + CSDM Teams

**Rationale:** Both ADRs add columns to `deployment_profiles` and share the DP card UI. Ship schema together in one DB session, then frontend in 1-2 sessions. Avoids two rounds of DP card redesign.

#### A.1 — Database Session (~3 hours)

| # | Work | ADR Source | Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| A.1.1 | Add 4 contract columns on `deployment_profiles` + partial index | Contract-Aware Cost Bundles §4.1 | 30 min |
| A.1.2 | Create `vw_contract_expiry` UNION view + grants | Contract-Aware Cost Bundles §4.2 | 30 min |
| A.1.3 | Create `teams` table + RLS + audit + grants | CSDM Export Readiness §4.1 | 1 hr |
| A.1.4 | Add 3 team FK columns on `deployment_profiles` | CSDM Export Readiness §4.2 | 30 min |
| A.1.5 | Update `deployment_profile_contacts` CHECK constraint (add `change_control`) | CSDM Export Readiness §4.3 | 15 min |
| A.1.6 | Run schema checkpoint (security posture + tsc) | — | 15 min |

**Schema delta:** +1 table (`teams`), +1 view (`vw_contract_expiry`), +7 columns on `deployment_profiles`, +1 CHECK update. Expected new stats: 100 tables, 39 views.

#### A.2 — Frontend Session: Contract-Aware Cost Bundles (~5 hours)

| # | Work | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| A.2.1 | Contract details section on Cost Bundle card (collapsible, 4 fields) | 2 hrs |
| A.2.2 | Update `ContractExpiryWidget` to query `vw_contract_expiry` (UNION view) | 1 hr |
| A.2.3 | Double-count warning: Add Cost Bundle → check for IT Service allocations | 1 hr |
| A.2.4 | Double-count prompt: Add IT Service → check for contract-bearing Cost Bundles | 1 hr |

#### A.3 — Frontend Session: CSDM Teams + Operations (~5 hours)

| # | Work | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| A.3.1 | Team management screen (namespace admin settings — CRUD list) | 2 hrs |
| A.3.2 | Operations section on DP card (3 team dropdowns with plain-English labels) | 3 hrs |

**Note:** A.2 and A.3 can run as **parallel sessions** if files don't overlap. The Cost Bundle card changes (A.2) and the Operations section (A.3) are different parts of the DP card. Verify file ownership before parallelizing.

**Stage A total: ~13 hours (1 DB session + 2 frontend sessions)**

---

### Stage B: Integration-DP Phase 3 — DP Selector in Connections

**Rationale:** Completes the integration-DP ADR. The DP selector in the Add Connection modal was designed to ship alongside the CSDM Export DP card changes (§6.3). After Stage A, the DP card has its final layout.

| # | Work | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| B.1 | Update `VwIntegrationDetail` TypeScript types for 4 DP columns (open item #68) | 0.5 day |
| B.2 | DP selector in Add Connection modal (show only when app has multiple DPs) | 3 hrs |
| B.3 | Connections list: show DP name alongside app name when DP specified | 1 hr |
| B.4 | Data migration: assign existing integrations to primary DP | 1 hr (DB) |

**Stage B total: ~1.5 days (1 frontend session + 1 small DB task)**

---

### Stage C: Visual Tab React Flow — Resume Parked Branch

**Rationale:** The branch was parked waiting for DP-level integrations (Stage B). After Stage B, Level 3 blast radius has accurate, DP-scoped data.

| # | Work | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| C.1 | Rebase `feat/visual-tab-reactflow` onto dev (branch diverged since Mar 19) | 0.5 hr |
| C.2 | Wire Level 3 blast radius to DP-scoped integration data | 1 day |
| C.3 | Fix known gaps: TB layout direction, double-click for L3, hover tooltips | 0.5 day |
| C.4 | QA and merge | 0.5 day |

**Stage C total: ~2.5 days (1-2 frontend sessions)**

---

### Stage D: CSDM Export Engine (Phase 37 — FUTURE, Q3+)

**Rationale:** Export views and publish engine depend on teams (Stage A), contracts (Stage A), and DP-level integrations (Stage B). This is the "big one" — ServiceNow + HaloITSM publish/subscribe. Scoped at 15-20 days in the open items matrix.

| # | Work | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| D.1 | Export views: `vw_csdm_business_app` with criticality derivation | 2 hrs |
| D.2 | Export views: `vw_csdm_service_auto` with team→group mapping | 2 hrs |
| D.3 | Cost Bundle → `ast_contract` export mapping | 2 hrs |
| D.4 | ServiceNow publish API integration | 10-15 days |
| D.5 | HaloITSM publish/subscribe | 5 days |

**Stage D total: 15-20 days. Not scheduled for April/May.**

---

## 5. Independent Work — Interleave Between Stages

These features have **no dependencies** on the ADR chain and can fill gaps between stages or run in parallel sessions.

### Tier 1: High Customer Value / Low Effort

| Item | Source | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| #57 Scope indicator | Open items | 0.5 day | "N of M workspaces" visibility indicator. Quick win. |
| #65 Budget alerts frontend | Open items | 1-2 days | DB layer deployed. Frontend pending. |
| #66 Assessment tour (Shepherd.js) | Open items | 0.5 day | Shepherd already integrated. |
| #63 Servers on dashboard | Open items | 0.5 day | Visual tab done. Dashboard remaining. |

### Tier 2: Designed Features

| Feature | Doc | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gamification Phase 1** | `features/gamification/architecture.md` v1.2 | 2-3 days | Audit-log-driven achievements + data quality flags. Schema: 4 new tables, 1 view, 9 functions. Includes #44 (flag CREATE viewer exception). Self-contained — no dependencies on ADR chain. **Consider scheduling between Stage A and B for variety.** |
| Tech Scoring Patterns | `features/assessment/tech-scoring-patterns.md` | 1-2 days | Pre-fill T-score defaults. Reduces assessment fatigue. |
| Business Capability | `catalogs/business-capability.md` v1.0 | 2-3 days | Hierarchical taxonomy. Additive. |
| Application Relationships (Suites) | `core/composite-application.md` v2.0 | 2-3 days | Suite/family relationships. Schema changes needed. |
| Standards Intelligence Phase 2 | `features/technology-health/standards-intelligence.md` | 2-3 days | T-score integration. Phase 1 deployed. |
| Realtime Subscriptions | `features/realtime-subscriptions/architecture.md` v1.0 | 2-3 days | Backend deployed. Frontend hooks pending. |

### Tier 3: Larger Initiatives (Q2+)

| Feature | Doc | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Entra ID / Enterprise SSO** | `identity-security/identity-security.md` | TBD | Identity/Security rewrite v1.1 → v2.0. Namespace-level IdP config, JIT provisioning, SAML support (Saskatchewan Account). **Deferred to Q2.** Not blocked by ADR chain. Enterprise sales enabler — "do you support SSO?" |
| R.8 Legacy cost column migration | `cost-model-validation-2026-03-04.md` | 12-14 hrs | Replace 16-file dependency on `annual_licensing_cost`/`annual_tech_cost` with cost channel views. **Best scheduled after Stage A** (contract-aware Cost Bundles reduce the cost entry confusion during migration). |
| Cloud Discovery | `features/cloud-discovery/architecture.md` | Large | AWS/Azure/GCP connectors. Enterprise feature. |
| Unified Chat | `features/support/unified-chat-integration.md` | Large | Depends on Edge Functions + AI Chat + persistence. |
| AI Chat V3 | `features/ai-chat/v3-multicloud.md` | 3-5 days | Multi-cloud cost lookup. |
